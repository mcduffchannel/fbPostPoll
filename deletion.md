**Last updated:** 27 December 2025

## Overview

This application (“the App”) uses Facebook (Meta) APIs to access limited data for user-requested functionality such as retrieving post metadata (for example, timestamps).

The App does **not** permanently store personal data.

### Option 1: Remove App Access via Facebook

1. Go to **Facebook Settings**
